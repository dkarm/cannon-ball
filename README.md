# cannon-ball

This is an attempt to create a simulation of a cannonball leaving a cannon and hitting a target. There are four classes in this document- ball, cannon, target, powerbar.

In the first step, the user sets the power of the cannon by pressing space. 
In the second step, the user sets the direction that the cannon will point.
Then the user shoots, and if the ball hits the target, a "you win" message is displayed.

This has not been completed yet.
